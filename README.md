# Emotion Color

Collaboration with ChatGPT.

Original prompt: 

> "Pretend you are able to create descriptions of colors just based on
their names, and also create hex codes for those colors, based on
their description. First, describe what a color named "nostalgia"
would look like, and then create what you think its hex code might be."

Other emotions in the map also come from ChatGPT.
